If you want to mine specific games first, use the \"Priority\" list to setup an ordered list of games of your choice. Games from the top of the list will be attempted to be mined first, before the ones lower down the list.\n5. Keep the \"Priority only\" option checked, to avoid mining games that are not on the priority list. Or not - it's up to you.\n6. Use the \"Exclude\" list to tell the application which games should never be mined.\n7. Changing the contents of either of the lists, or changing the state of the \"Priority only\" option, requires you to press on \"Reload\" for the changes to take an effect."
